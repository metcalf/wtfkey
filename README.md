# wtfkey

This is a purely annoying and pointless piece of software. When
running as root, it randomly replaces some typed keys with entire
words that start with the same letter. The frequency of replacement is
configured by passing a single integer argument. For example, if the
selected keypress was `i` wtfkey might insert ` irritant `. Setting a
high frequency is much more confusing since it can take a long time to
figure out that something is amiss.

## Why?

* Encourage coworkers not to leave their laptops unlocked.
* Give away your old laptop with a "fun" easter egg.
* Test your own proofreading skills.

Or don't... it's kind of mean.
